# NekoAssist
a bootleg drag and drop clipboard

its in a pretty rough condition now, this is the first version of my first programm with 
more than 100 lines of code, im looking forward for any kind of critique.

feachures that i want to add in future:
1. changable number of max files (thinking of how to manage the layout and keep the main widget visable)
2. add more formats (for now only jpg, jpeg, png, bmp and plain text)

if you dont understand the methods i choose, keep in mind that i dont realy know what i'm doing, i've been studying Qt for only couple months
